# Python for Data Science

Data enables us to understand the world around us. Whether we're gathering 
data about our natural world to understand how it is changing, or analyzing 
patterns in how societies grow and change to ensure we're supporting all 
people, data is what drives the conversation. In this workshop, we 
invite you to take the first step to learning how to understand data. With 
the power of Python, you will be able to explore data more quickly and 
develop more complex learnings from that data with just a few lines of code.
